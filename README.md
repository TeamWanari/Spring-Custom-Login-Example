# Spring-Custom-Login-Example

This is an example project for my [blog post](http://leaks.wanari.com/2017/11/28/how-to-make-custom-usernamepasswordauthenticationfilter-with-spring-security/?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=suxyreadme). You can try the APIs for example with [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/32808fe579f4ee2cc6aa)

## Installation

There is a Maven wrapper pushed to the repository so you can run the project with that file (`mvnw` or `mvnw.cmd`).
